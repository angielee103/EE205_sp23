# EE205_sp23
- Hi, I'm Angie! 
- I’m interested in lots of things, right now I love playing video games and learning more about computer software/hardware.
- I’m currently learning lost of basic skills for computer engineering such as circuts and software engineering.
- I'm originally from Oahu.
- I'm a SOPHOMORE in computer engineering.
- I chose my major because the tech industry is interesting and it is becoming increasingly more important in our society. 
- A fun fact about me is: I love to play the guitar and sing. Even though I don't have a whole lot of time for music these days...
- What do I want to learn from EE 205? I really would like to hone my programming skills and learn to code more efficently. 
- A book or movie I'd recommend is: There are too many good books for me to reccomend just one. However, the most recent one I read is called 'Sabriel'.
